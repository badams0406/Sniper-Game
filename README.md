Directions:
You will implement a sniper game. The game can be mobile or desktop application. You can
also make it a web application. The sniper will be stable, won’t move but hiding in a spot
where she/he can see the view. There will be a mission. Note that the mission will not be just
shooting one stable target but slightly more complicated. The player may need to kill a target
and shoot an item (a secret bag/document case) to destroy it. Maybe someone is carrying a
bomb in the scene and the player may need to shoot the bomb bag when the main target
approaches the bag. The enemies will be aware if there is a shot fired near. Probably there
will be guards or civilians in the scene. Once they hear a gunshot they may run away,
making the «mission failed» for the player. You will need to add more than 1 target which can
be objects or humans. The targets will sometimes appear in the scene and sometimes
disappear. The player will start with a constant amount of money. With his money he can buy
upgrades to his weapon. Silencer might stop the enemies from hearing the gunshots. The
magazine size or accuracy can be increased. The accuracy won’t be deterministic. There
should be some random recoil. There will be at least 3 missions. You can use the same
scene if you make it complicated enough.
